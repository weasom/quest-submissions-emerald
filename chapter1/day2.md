## What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
  1) Safety and Security
  2) Clarity
  3) Approachability
  4) Developer Experience
  5) Resource Oriented Programming

## In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
### Safety and Security
  As a user, knowing that there are high levels of scrutiny involved to make sure that the code is secure and my interactions are safe make me comfortable.
### Clarity/Developer Experience
  Having little coding experience knowing the code is going to be easy to read and includes useful error messages reduces my anxiety in getting started. 
### Approachability
  While I don't have a lot of coding experience this seems that it would be useful in having examples from other languages to solve similar problems.
