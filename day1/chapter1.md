    Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. 
      -The Blockchain is an open way for people to interact with smart contracts through transactions. 
      -It is decentralized, open, and acts as a database to store and retrieve information. 
      -The decentralised nature means that no one "owns" the Blockchain. 
      -The open aspect means that anyone can interact with the Blockchain. 
      -The database aspect is because it can accept input, store the information, and that data can be retrieved. 
      -The Blockchain is also public meaning that anyone can view the data stored within. 

    Explain what a Smart Contract is. 
      -A smart contract is code that contains functions for people to interact with and provide input to the Blockchain.
      -Once a smart contract is deployed to the Blockchain, anyone can interact with it.

    Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.
      -Scripts and transactions both interact with the Blockchain in some form.
      -Scripts allow one to view, for free, the data on the Blockchain.
      -Transactions execute the functions, at a cost, within the smart contracts.
